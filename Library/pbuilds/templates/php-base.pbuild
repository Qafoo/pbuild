##
# Execute further operations after the current php version has been installed.
#
# These operations may include installing pear and pecl packages for the
# current version, manipulating the configuration file or doing anything else
# necessary in conjunction with this php install.
#
# If you need to execute binaries from the just installed php version take into
# account, that they may not be within the search path. Therefore always call
# them with their full path.
#
# You may use the convinience wrapper pbin, which will call arbitrary
# executables from inside the just installed php version. For often used
# commands aliases exist as well: pphp, ppear, ppecl.
#
# The directory the new php version has been installed to can be reached using
# ${P} or ${D}, the directory searched for the php.ini is available using ${C}.
#
# The ${S} variable still points to the source tree, which php has been
# installed from. This is useful if certain files should be copied over from
# there, like the config samples for example.
